        <h2> General Information </h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Caleb Daguerressar, a computer science major at California State University, San Bernardino, 
            entering my final year. I'm passionate about technology and looking forward to a career in the field. 
            Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing the guitar and piano in my free time, 
            finding a balance between logic and creativity.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Experience in Coding</h2>
        <p>
            Over the past few years, I have been able to learn various things about the computer science world. 
            From schooling, I have gained proficiency in coding languages 
            such as C++, C, Python, HTML, CSS, and Java.
        </p>
        
        <h2>After College</h2>
        <p>
            After I graduate, I want to start working in computer engineering and IT 
            at In-N-Out, the company where I currently work. Hopefully, after a year of 
            experience, I can return to school and pursue my master's degree.
        </p>
